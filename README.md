This is our project for the Introduction to Unity seminar WS 2020/21!

Following we will tell you how our amazing project works:

We created a Donut in Blender, that will fight against Fruits and Vegetables. 

Use your mouse to shoot and rotate the ankle of the Donut. With help of your arrow keys you can move for- and backwards and so sides. 

You have to collect the golden Coins, each will bring 1 Point. If you collect the rotating sweets you will receive 5 points extra.

Good Look, but be carful the healthy food wants to kill you!
